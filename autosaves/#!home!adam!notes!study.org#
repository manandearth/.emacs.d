* For Juan project

** TODO docs.expo.io
https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/facebook that eases the
android/ios development writing only javascript 12:13 PM well, there
is also a interesting clojurescript way to use expo.io
https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-clojurescript 12:14
PM that uses internally https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent
reagent-project/reagent A minimalistic ClojureScript interface to
React.js Website http://reagent-project.github.io/ Stars 3242
￼reagent-project/reagentDec 18th, 2013Added by GitHub 12:15 PM so i
think it could be used with https://github.com/Day8/re-frame too
Day8/re-frame A Reagent Framework For Writing SPAs, in Clojurescript.
Stars 3505 Language Clojure ￼Day8/re-frameDec 5th, 2014Added by GitHub
12:15 PM re-frame is very interesting to get robust UI code 12:16 PM …
12:16 PM so the thing is setting up a prototype that uses
re-frame-with-expo (edited) 12:17 PM to solve “easy and simple” movile
apps 12:18 PM but … we need also a backend side to make this mobile
apps useful ￼ 

** TODO clojurescript-on-google-cloud-functions
related to backend … I’m very inclined to use
free version usage of gcloud
http://blog.colinwilliams.name/clojure/2017/05/13/clojurescript-on-google-cloud-functions.html
blog.colinwilliams.name ClojureScript On Google Cloud Functions I
wanted to try out Google Cloud Functions, and when I saw that it only
supported JavaScript I thought “What a perfect opportunity to try
ClojureScript as we... ￼

* For Migres
** TODO find out about meta data and relating it to postgres.<2018-12-22 Sat>
This is for Pablo in Migres, I am looking for a way to collaborate
with them.

preyes@fundacionmigres.org
[2019-01-13 Sun] sent him the spheres project.

* For vemv

** https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/edging-forward.html , being reasonably productive with it, being able to implement some sample features

** TODO Cool! It also might help you at some point my Emacs distro https://github.com/zenmacs/.emacs.d , as the README explains it's rather unique and easy.

** the Seemann (in the Magnet convo) article is really good, and also relatively easy to grasp. Shows us how we can do 'purer' FP without resorting to monads/etc

* data science

** bherrmann [12:42 PM]
any recommendations for a clojure notebook which can run locally?

henrygarner [12:44 PM]
@bherrmann I get a lot of mileage out of http://gorilla-repl.org/ and https://github.com/JonyEpsilon/gg4clj (edited)

bherrmann [12:47 PM]
@henrygarner Thanks!
